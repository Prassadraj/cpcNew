                      <strong>How It Works:</strong> The IFLASH 1200 operates on the Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) principle. It uses chemiluminescent reactions to detect the presence of specific antigens or antibodies in a sample. When a sample is introduced, it interacts with labeled antibodies, producing a light-emitting reaction. The emitted light is measured by a photomultiplier tube, providing precise quantification of the analyte concentration.

The light emitted during this reaction is measured, and the intensity is proportional to the concentration of the analyte, providing highly accurate results. The entire process is automated, from sample loading to result generation, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

                      <strong className="text-nowrap">Working Principle:</strong> The KRYPTOR Compact Plus operates using TRACE (Time Resolved Amplified Cryptate Emission) technology, a highly sensitive method for detecting biomarkers in biological samples. This technology utilizes the unique properties of europium cryptate and XL665, which emit fluorescence when bound to specific biomarkers. The intensity of the fluorescence is measured and is directly proportional to the concentration of the target biomarker, such as procalcitonin. The system is fully automated, from sample preparation to result generation, ensuring high accuracy and reproducibility.
